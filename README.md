# The Wander Times
A news website for the techie wanderlust. The app includes two main categories, tech and travel. These are my
two favorite topics to read online. I created a web app using the News API for the most up to date articles that users can favorite, save and remove. The app was created with a React front end and Ruby on Rails backend with the full authentication.
